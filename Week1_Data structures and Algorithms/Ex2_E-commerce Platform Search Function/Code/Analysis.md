### üîç Time Complexity Comparison

| Algorithm       | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Sorted Data Required |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Linear Search** | O(1)     | O(n)         | O(n)       | ‚ùå No                |
| **Binary Search** | O(1)     | O(log n)     | O(log n)   | ‚úÖ Yes               |

- **Linear Search** scans elements one by one.
- **Binary Search** divides the array in half repeatedly, but only works on sorted data.

### üí¨ Algorithm Suitability for E-commerce Platform

For a large-scale e-commerce platform:

- **Binary Search** is more suitable because:
  - It provides significantly faster search times on large datasets (logarithmic complexity).
  - Product data can be sorted or indexed once and reused efficiently.
  - It scales well with growing catalogs and real-time search features.

- **Linear Search** is only practical for:
  - Small datasets
  - Unsophisticated internal tools
  - Scenarios where data is unsorted and sorting overhead isn't justified

‚û°Ô∏è **Recommendation**: Use Binary Search or even more optimized data structures (e.g., hash maps, search trees) for customer-facing search functionality where speed is critical.
